# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

First of all, please make sure if the back-end is running on your side.

### Download or clone the repository and extract it.

### In the project directory, update the file name .env-example to .env.
If the back-end url on your side is not the same as the env variable, please update.

### And you can run: yarn install

### Also run: yarn start
If the console shows a success message, then open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

## Used tools (front-end)
React 17, Material UI 5, axios

## And also I updated the back-end to convert the data type.
